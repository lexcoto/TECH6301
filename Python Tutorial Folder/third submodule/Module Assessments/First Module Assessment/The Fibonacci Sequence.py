# The Fibonacci Sequence

# Requirements
# Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence for a count given by the user. 

### Note: I interpret this ^^ to mean the user specifies how many numbers of the fibonnaci sequence is run

# Define your required variables.
# Take the input from the user.
# Start the loop to get the Fibonacci numbers for the userâ€™s input.
# Print the number of every loop.

### Note: I'm interpreting this ^^^ to mean you label each loop after the first two numbers

    num2 = 1

    loop_amt = question - 2 # The way I'm interpreting this, the user is asked for the length of the whole 
                               # sequence (including the first two numbers), not just the number of loops. 
                               # so user input would have to be input - 2
    if loop_amt == -1 : # if they enter a 1 then loop_amt would be -1, so this part just prints the first number
        print('First number: ', num1)
